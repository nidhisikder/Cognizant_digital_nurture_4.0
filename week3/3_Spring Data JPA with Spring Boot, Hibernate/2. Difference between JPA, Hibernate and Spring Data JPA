JPA (Java Persistence API):
It is a specification defined under JSR 338 or Interface
Function: It defines how Java objects map to relational database tables (ORM).
It doesn't provide implementation.

Hibernate:
It is one of the most popular JPA implementation (ORM Provider).
Function: It provides additional features over JPA, such as lazy loading, caching, SQL dialects, and HQL (Hibernate Query Language). It persists Java objects to the database.
It provides implementation and uses classes like Session, Transaction.

Spring Data JPA:
It is a part of Spring ecosystem. It is built on top of JPA and Hibernate, acts as an abstract layer over JPA and Hibernate.
Function: It simplifies JPA development using repositories. It allows defining repository interfaces â€” Spring will generate the implementation automatically.It supports custom query methods (e.g., findByName, findByAgeGreaterThan).
It removes the need for writing common CRUD code and handles them. 

Code Comparison

Using Hibernate directly
java
Copy
Edit
public Integer addEmployee(Employee employee) {
    Session session = factory.openSession();
    Transaction tx = null;
    Integer employeeID = null;

    try {
        tx = session.beginTransaction();
        employeeID = (Integer) session.save(employee); 
        tx.commit();
    } catch (HibernateException e) {
        if (tx != null) tx.rollback();
        e.printStackTrace(); 
    } finally {
        session.close(); 
    }
    return employeeID;
}

Using Spring Data JPA
java
Copy
Edit
@Repository
public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<Employee, Integer> {
}
java
Copy
Edit
@Service
public class EmployeeService {
    @Autowired
    private EmployeeRepository employeeRepository;

    @Transactional
    public void addEmployee(Employee employee) {
        employeeRepository.save(employee);
    }
}


Conclusion 
JPA is the "what" (specification).
Hibernate is the "how" (implementation).
Spring Data JPA is the "make it easy" (abstraction).

They work such that Spring Data JPA uses JPA implemented by Hibernate.
